In this project, we designed our own photonic crystal fibre which has a high negative dispersion coefficient. This high negative dispersion coefficient helped to reduce the confinement loss that exists in photonic crystal fibers.
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is a kind of optical fiber that uses photonic crystals to form the cladding around the core of the cable.They also known as holey fibers.
