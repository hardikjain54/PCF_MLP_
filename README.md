******In this project, we designed our own photonic crystal fibre which has a high negative dispersion coefficient. This high negative dispersion coefficient helped to reduce the confinement loss that exists in photonic crystal fibers.
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is a kind of optical fiber that uses photonic crystals to form the cladding around the core of the cable.They also known as holey fibers.**


Overall, reducing confinement loss in PCFs can lead to various advantages across a wide range of applications, including improved transmission efficiency, enhanced nonlinear optical effects, increased sensitivity in fiber sensors, and better performance in high-power fiber lasers. ********
