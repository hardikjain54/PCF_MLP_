**In this project, we designed our own photonic crystal fibre which has a high negative dispersion coefficient. This high negative dispersion coefficient helped to reduce the confinement loss that exists in photonic crystal fibers.
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is a kind of optical fiber that uses photonic crystals to form the cladding around the core of the cable.They also known as holey fibers.**

**Confinement loss in photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) refers to the loss of optical power that occurs when light propagates through the fiber and interacts with the surrounding medium.**

****Overall, reducing confinement loss in PCFs can lead to various advantages 
1 improved transmission efficiency
2 enhanced nonlinear optical effects, 
3 increased sensitivity in fiber sensors 
4. better performance in high-power fiber lasers. ****
